# The arithmetic behind the three-block window argument (Section 5.2)

The head trace below is an integer-valued position function.  Its step
bound is explicit, not inferred merely from bijectivity of an address
permutation. These lemmas justify window amortization ONCE an actual
implementation is proved to have this trace. No implementation is assumed
to exist, and no full I/O theorem is asserted here.
