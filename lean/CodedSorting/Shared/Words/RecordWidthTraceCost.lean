/-! Explicit scan charges for records occupying r physical words.
The exchange charge already covers every bit of a complete record. All
other scans and terminal batches below transfer r words per record. This
is a cost-annotation comparison on the actual Columnsort trace, not a claim
that a complete bounded-RAM implementation has already been constructed. -/
