# Concrete bucket streams and block transfers

This module defines the streams and their physical blocks as finite lists.
Each element denotes one fixed-size storage unit.  One block transfer moves
one list of at most B such units.  Costs are counted from those actual lists
of blocks, rather than supplied as a scan-cost hypothesis.
