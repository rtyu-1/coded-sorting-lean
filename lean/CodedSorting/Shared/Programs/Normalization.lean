# Explicit block-size simulation for Appendix A

A logical block is represented by the blockPrefix of its own physical block.
The simulator has the SAME finite work memory plus ONE physical block buffer.
This file defines read, write, and local-computation transitions, and proves
simulation for arbitrary memory-dependent command policies and finite runs.
The I/O cost is computed from the actual transition constructors, not supplied
as a hypothesis. Compact-layout conversion and logarithmic parameter transfer
are not proved by this module.
