/-! Concrete constant-buffer interval materialization and gathering for 7.1.
The input rows are disk streams produced by local sorting. Each interval is
written to an aligned scratch file, then the directory is traversed in
key/row order. This adds one sequential pass to the manuscript's direct
interval-reading description, without changing its asymptotic bound. -/
