# The helper-pool schedule for three cyclic copies

Pool `(i,b,c)` is used once in each globally separated round.  The three
associated blocks are `(i,b,c)`, `(i-1,b,pi c)`, and `(i+1,pi b,pi c)`.
In a block triple the first component names the data copy.  The last two
components label the coordinates following the currently processed axis;
the processed axis in rounds one, two, and three is respectively the copy
label, its successor, and its second successor.

These are scheduling facts only.  Orthogonality of the lines, monotonicity of
their frames, restoration of dirty helper contents, and the rank charge must
be established separately before this schedule is used in the construction.

section TensorLiftProgram
/-! Programs for the three-copy construction. Each round applies the XOR instruction sequence to each disjoint coordinate slice. Original registers are indexed by ThreeCopySchedule.IndependentStream; temporary copies are allocated separately for each round and block. The theorem specifies how these programs transform register values.
